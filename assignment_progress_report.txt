Approximate additional time spent on various tasks:

Argument parsing - 1 hour - previous knowlege: Some
Assembling the python project - 1 hour - previous knowlege: Some

The rest of the subtasks didn't require any additional research, time spent on them is counted in with:
Writing, refactoring and testing the code - 10 hours

Concluding thoughts:
I found the time requirements a bit too strict for me, resulting in close to no polish and minimal by-hand testing.
